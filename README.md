# Python-Test-Automation-Facebook-example- 

You can watch it on the movie I added here.

# Automation of login to facebook and entry into the user's profile.


* To run the test correctly, start the Python Terminal or Windows CMD and perform the following steps:

# go to the project
 
*In the code you have to enter your path to the chromedriver:
# DRIVER_PATH = r'X:\users\'  ( "r" symbol for Windows users)

*In this place -> 
# profile = driver.find_element_by_xpath("//span[@class='xxx'][contains(.,'xxx')]")
you must you must enter the "Page Object Xpath" path for your profile


# select the folder "venv" -> go to "Scripts" -> find the file "python.exe" -> right click "copy path" -> paste to the python terminal or Windows CMD


# find facebook.py -> right mouse button "copy path" -> paste into the console and press Enter

# after that you will see prompt with username (facebook mail or phone number) and password prommpt (entering the password can not be seen is hidden by default)

# If you log in correctly, the browser window : will open, log in to your facebook and enter your profile, facebook main page, news, adding new post and then closes itself.
